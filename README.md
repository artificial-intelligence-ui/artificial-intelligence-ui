python -m venv webcrawler-env
source webcrawler-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: webcrawler-env\Scripts\activate
Step 2: Install Required Packages
Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

txt
beautifulsoup4==4.9.3
certifi==2020.12.5
cryptography==3.3.1
psutil==5.8.0
requests==2.25.1
validators==0.18.2
Then install the dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Save the Web Crawler Code
Save the refined web crawler code into a file named web_crawler.py.

Step 4: Run the Web Crawler
You can run the web crawler using the following command:

bash
python web_crawler.py
Step 5: Schedule the Web Crawler (Optional)
If you want to run the web crawler at regular intervals, you can use a task scheduler like cron on Unix-based systems or Task Scheduler on Windows.

Using cron (Unix-based systems):
Open the crontab file:

bash
crontab -e
Add a cron job to run the web crawler every day at 2 AM:

bash
0 2 * * * /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/python /path/to/your/web_crawler.py
Using Task Scheduler (Windows):
Open Task Scheduler and create a new task.
Set the trigger to run daily at your desired time.
Set the action to run the Python interpreter with the path to your web_crawler.py script.
Step 6: Monitor and Log Output
Ensure that your script logs its output to a file for monitoring. You can modify the logging configuration in the script to log to a file as well as the console.

Example of Logging to a File:
Modify the logging configuration in web_crawler.py:

Python
# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("webcrawler.log"),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
